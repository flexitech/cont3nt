	<div class="divPri">	
		<p class="pPri">There are many different ways you can use our services to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Cont3nt.com Account, we can make those services even better to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we're using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.
		</p>

		<h4 class="h4Pri">Our Privacy Policy explains:</h4>

		<ul class ="ulPri">		
			<li>What information we collect and why we collect it.</li>
			<li>How we use that information.</li>
			<li>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="pPriNo">We have tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you're not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Cont3nt.com so whether you are new to Cont3nt.com or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices and if you have any questions contact us at contact@cont3nt.com</p>

		<h4 class="h4Pri">Information we collect</h4>

		<p class="pPriNo">We collect information to provide better services to all of our users from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you'll find most useful or the people who matter most to you online.</p>

		<h4 class="h4Pri">We collect information in two ways:</h4>
		<ul class ="ulPri">
		<li>Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Cont3nt.com Account. When you do, we'll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Cont3nt.com or MediaReputations.com profile, which may include your name and photo.</li>

		<li>Information we get from your use of our services. We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="h4PriUl">Device information</h4>	

		<p class="pPriUl">We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Cont3nt.com may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Cont3nt.com Account.</p>	

		<h4 class="h4PriUl">Log information</h4>

		<p class="pPriUl">When you use our services or view content provided by Cont3nt.com, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include:</p>	

		<ul class="ulul">	
			<li>details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.</li>
			<li>telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls.</li>
			<li>Internet protocol address</li>
			<li>Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.</li>
			<li>Cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Cont3nt.com Account.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="h4PriUl">Location information</h4>

		<p class="pPriUl">When you use a location-enabled Cont3nt.com service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.</p>

		<h4 class="h4PriUl">Unique application numbers</h4>

		<p class="pPriUl">Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Cont3nt.com when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.</p>

		<h4 class="h4PriUl">Local storage</h4>

		<p class="pPriUl">We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.</p>

		<h4 class="h4PriUl">Cookies and anonymous identifiers</h4>

		<p class="pPriUl">We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Cont3nt.com service, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Cont3nt.com features that may appear on other sites.</p>

		<h4 class="h4Pri">How we use information we collect</h4>

		<p class="pPriNo">We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Cont3nt.com and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content like giving you more relevant search results and ads.
		<br/><br/>
		We may use the name you provide for your Cont3nt.com Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Cont3nt.com Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Cont3nt.com Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Cont3nt.com Profile information, such as your name and photo.
		<br/><br/>
		When you contact Cont3nt.com, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.
		<br/><br/>
		We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. For example, by saving your language preferences, we'll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.
		<br/><br/>
		We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Cont3nt.com services for example to make it easier to share things with people you know.
		<br/><br/>
		We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.
		<br/><br/>
		Cont3nt.com processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.</p>


		<h4 class="h4Pri">Transparency and choice</h4>

		<p class="pPriNo">People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:</p>

		<ul class ="ulPri">		
			<li>Review and control certain types of information tied to your Cont3nt.com Account by using Cont3nt.com Dashboard.
			</li>
			<li>Use our editor to see and adjust how your Cont3nt.com Profile appears to particular individuals.</li>
			<li>Control who you share information with.</li>
			<li>Take information out of many of our services.</li>
		</ul>
